## Abstract

Simplex messaging protocol is a transport agnostic client-server protocol for
asynchronous distributed secure unidirectional message transmission via
persistent simplex message queues.

It's designed with the focus on communication security and integrity, under the
assumption that any part of the message transmission network can be compromised.

It is designed as a low level protocol for other application protocols to solve
the problem of secure and private message transmission, making [MITM attack][1]
very difficult at any part of the message transmission system.

## Introduction

The objective of Simplex Messaging Protocol (SMP) is to facilitate the secure
and private unidirectional transfer of messages from senders to recipients via
persistent simplex queues.

SMP is independent of the particular transmission system and requires only a
reliable ordered data stream channel. While this document describes transport
over TCP, other transports are also possible.

The protocol describes the set of commands that recipient and sender can
exchange with the SMP server to create and to operate a unidirectional "queue"
(a data abstraction identifying one of many communication channels managed by
the server) and to send messages from the sender to the recipient via the SMP
server.

More complex communication scenarios can be designed using multiple queues - for
example, a duplex communication channel can be made of 2 simplex queues.

Protocol is designed with the focus on privacy and security, to some extent
deprioritizing reliability by requiring that SMP servers only store messages
until they are delivered to the recipients and, in any case, for a limited
period of time. For communication scenarios requiring more reliable transmission
the users should use several SMP servers to pass each message and implement some
additional protocol to ensure that messages are not removed, inserted or
re-ordered - this is out of scope of this document.

SMP removes the need for participants' identities and provides [E2EE][2] without
the possibility of [MITM attack][1] relying on two pre-requisites:

- the users can establish a secure encrypted transport connection with the SMP
  server. [Appendix A](#appendix-a) has a possible simple protocol of such
  transport connection over TCP, but any other transport connection encryption
  protocol can be used.
- the recipient can pass a single message to the sender via pre-existing secure
  and private communication channel (out-of-band message) - the information in
  this message is used to encrypt messages and to establish connection with SMP
  server.

## SMP Model

The SMP model has three communication participants: the recipient, the message
broker (SMP server) that is chosen and, possibly, controlled by the recipient,
and the sender.

SMP server manages multiple "simplex queues" - data records on the server that
identify communication channels from the senders to the recipients. The same
communicating party that is the sender in one queue, can be the recipient in
another - without exposing this fact to the server.

The queue record consists of 2 unique random IDs generated by the server, one
for the recipient and another for the sender, and 2 keys to authenticate the
recipient and the sender respectively. The users of SMP protocol must use a
unique key for each queue, to avoid the possibility of aggregating and analysing
their queues in case SMP server is compromised.

Creating and using the queue requires sending commands to the SMP server from
the recipient and the sender - they are described in detail in
[SMP commands](#smp-commands) section.

## Out-of-band messages

The out-of band invitation message is sent via some trusted alternative channel
from the recipient to the sender. This message is used to share the encryption
(a.k.a. "public") key that the sender will use to encrypt the messages (to be
decrypted by the recipient), sender queue ID, server address and any other
information necessary to establish secure encrypted connection with SMP server
(see [Appendix A](#appendix-a) for a simple transport protocol example).

The [ABNF][8] syntax of the message is:

```abnf
outOfBandMsg = encryptionKey CRLF senderConnId CRLF server CRLF serverKeyHash
encryptionKey = encoded ; base64
senderConnId = encoded
server = hostname [":" port]
port = 1*DIGIT
serverKeyHash = encoded
```

`hostname` can be IP address or domain name, as defined in RFC 1123, section
2.1.

`port` is optional, the default TCP port for SMP protocol is 5223.

Defining the approach to out-of-band message passing is out of scope of this
protocol. See [Appendix B](#appendix-b) for one of the possible practical
approaches.

## Simplex queue

The simplex queue is the main unit of SMP protocol. It is used by:

- the sender of the queue (who received out-of-band message) to send messages to
  the server using sender's queue ID, signed by sender's key.
- the recepient of the queue (who created the queue and who sent out-of-band
  message) will use it to retrieve messages from the server, signing the
  commands by the recepient key.
- participant identities are not shared with the server - new unique keys and
  queue IDs are used for each queue.

This simplex queue can serve as a building block for more complex communication
network. For example, two (or more, for redundancy) simplex queues can be used
to create a duplex communication channel. Higher level primitives that are only
known to system participants in their client applications can be created as
well - contacts, conversations, groups and broadcasts. Simplex messaging servers
only have the information about the low-level simplex queues. In this way a high
level of privacy and security of the conversations is provided. Application
level primitives are not in scope of this protocol.

This approach is based on the concept of [unidirectional networks][4] that are
used for applications with high level of information security.

Access to each queue is controlled with unique (not shared with other queues)
assymetric key pairs, separate for the sender and the recipient. The sender and
the receiver have private keys, and the server has associated public keys to
authenticate participants' commands by verifying cryptographic signatures.

The messages sent into the queue are encrypted and decrypted using another key
pair that was shared via out-of-band message - the recepient has the private key
and the sender has the associated public key.

**Simplex queue diagram:**

![Simplex queue](/diagrams/simplex-messaging/simplex.svg)

Queue is defined by recipient ID `RID` unique for the server. It also has a
different unique sender ID `SID`. Sender key (`SK`) is used by the server to
verify sender's commands (identified by `SID`) to send messages. Recipient key
(`RK`) is used by the server to verify recipient's commands (identified by
`SID`) to retrieve messages.

The protocol uses different IDs for sender and recipient in order to provide an
additional privacy by complicating correlation of senders and recipients
commands sent over the network - even though they are encrypted using server's
public key, in case this key is compromised it would still be difficult to
correlate senders and recipients without access to queue records on the server.

## SMP procedure

The SMP procedure of creating a simplex queue on SMP server is explained using
participants Alice (the recipient) who wants to receive the messages from Bob
(the sender).

To create and start using a simpelex queue Alice and Bob follow these steps:

1. Alice creates a simplex queue on the server:
   1. decides which SMP server to use (can be the same or different server that
      Alice uses for other queues) and opens secure encrypted transport
      connection to the chosen SMP server (see [Appendix A](#appendix-a)).
   2. generates a new random public/private key pair (encryption key - `EK`)
      that she did not use before for Bob to encrypt the messages.
   3. generates another new random public/private key pair (recepient key -
      `RK`) that she did not use before for her to sign commands and to decrypt
      the transmissions received from the server.
   4. sends `"CONN"` command to the server to create a simplex queue (see
      `create` in [Create queue command](#create-queue-command)). This command
      can either be anonymous or the server can be configured to use the
      signature field to authenticate the users who are allowed to create
      queues. This command contains previouisly generated uniqie "public" key
      `RK` that will be used to sign the following commands related to the same
      queue, for example to subscribe to the messages received to this queue or
      to update the queue, e.g. by setting the key required to send the messages
      (initially Alice creates the queue that accepts unsigned messages, so
      anybody could send the message via this queue if they knew the queue
      sender's ID and server address).
   5. The server sends `"IDS"` response with queue IDs (`queueIds`):
      - recipient ID `RID` for Alice to manage the queue and to receive the
        messages.
      - sender ID `SID` for Bob to send messages to the queue.
2. Alice sends an out-of-band message to Bob via the alternative channel that
   both Alice and Bob trust (see
   [Simplex messaging protocol abstract](#simplex-messaging-protocol-abstract)
   and [Appendix B](#appendix-b)). The message must include:
   - the unique "public" key (`EK`) that Bob must use to encrypt messages.
   - SMP server address and information to open secure encrypted transport
     connection (see [Appendix A](#appendix-a))
   - the sender queue ID `SID` for Bob to use.
3. Bob, having received the out-of-band message from Alice, connects to the
   queue:
   1. generates a new random public/private key pair (sender key - `SK`) that he
      did not use before for him to sign messages sent to Alice's server.
   2. prepares the confirmation message for Alice to secure the queue. This
      message includes:
      - previously generated "public" key `SK` that will be used by Alice's
        server to authenticate Bob's messages, once the queue is secured.
      - optionally, any additional information (application specific, e.g. Bob's
        profile name and details).
   3. encrypts the confirmation body with the "public" key `EK` (that Alice
      provided via the out-of-band message).
   4. sends the encrypted message to the server with queue ID `SID` (see `send`
      in [Send message](#send-message)). This initial message to the queue must
      not be signed - signed messages will be rejected until Alice secures the
      queue (below).
4. Alice receives Bob's message from the server using recipient queue ID `RID`
   (possibly, via the same transport connection she already has opened - see
   `message` in [Deliver queue message](#deliver-queue-message)):
   1. she decrypts received message with "private" key `EK`.
   2. even though anybody could have sent the message to the queue with ID `SID`
      before it is secured (e.g. if communication is compromised), Alice would
      ignore all messages until the decryption succeeds (i.e. the result
      contains the expected message format). Optionally, in the client
      application, she also may identify Bob using the information provided, but
      it is out of scope of SMP protocol.
5. Alice secures the queue `RID` with `"KEY"` command so only Bob can send
   messages to it (see [Secure queue command](#secure-queue-command)):
   1. she sends the command with `RID` signed with "private" key `RK` to update
      the queue to only accept requests signed by "private" key `SK` provided by
      Bob.
   2. From this moment the server will accept only signed commands to `SID`, so
      only Bob will be able to send messages to the queue `SID` (corresponding
      to `RID` that Alice has).
   3. Once queue is secured, Alice deletes `SID` and `SK` - even if Alice's
      client is compromised in the future, the attacker would not be able to
      send messages pretending to be Bob.
6. The simplex queue `RID` is now ready to use.

This flow is shown on the sequence diagram below.

**Creating simplex queue from Bob to Alice:**

![Creating queue](/diagrams/simplex-messaging/simplex-creating.svg)

Bob now can securely send messages to Alice:

1. Bob sends the message:
   1. he encrypts the message to Alice with "public" key `EK` (provided by
      Alice, only known to Alice and Bob, used only for one simplex queue).
   2. he signs `"SEND"` command to the server queue `SID` using the "private"
      key `SK` (that only he knows, used only for this queue).
   3. he sends the command to the server (see `send` in
      [Send message](#send-message)), that the server will authenticate using
      the "public" key `SK` (that Alice earlier provided to the server).
2. Alice receives the message(s):
   1. she signs `"SUB"` command to the server to subscribe to the queue `RID`
      with the "private" key `RK` (see `subscribe` in
      [Subscribe to queue](#subscribe-to-queue)).
   2. the server, having authenticated Alice's command with the "public" key
      `RK` that she provided, delivers Bob's message(s) (see `message` in
      [Deliver queue message](#deliver-queue-message)).
   3. she decrypts Bob's message(s) with the "private" key `EK` (that only she
      has).
   4. she acknowledges the message reception to the server with `"ACK"` so that
      the server can delete the message and deliver the next messages.

This flow is show on sequence diagram below.

**Simplex queue operation:**

![Simplex queue operations](/diagrams/simplex-messaging/simplex-op.svg)

Sequence diagram does not show E2EE - server knows nothing about encryption
between sender and receiver.

A higher level protocol application protocol should define the semantics that
allow to use two simplex queues (or two sets of queues for redundancy) for the
bi-directional chat and for any other communication scenarios.

The SMP is intentionally unidirectional - it provides no answer to how Bob will
know that the transmission succeeded, and whether Alice received any messages.
There may be a scenario when Alice wants to securely receive the messages from
Bob, but she does not want Bob to have any proof that she received any
messages - this low-level simplex messaging protocol can be used in this
scenario, as all Bob knows as a fact is that he was able to send one unsigned
message to the server that Alice provided, and now can only send messages signed
with the key `SK` that he sent to the server - it does not prove that any
message was received by Alice.

For practical purposes of bi-directional conversation, now that Bob can securely
send encrypted messages to Alice, Bob can create the second simplex queue that
will allow Alice to send messages to Bob in the same way, sending the second
queue details via the first queue. If both Alice and Bob have their respective
uniqie "public" keys (Alice's and Bob's `EK`s of two separate queues), the
conversation can be both encrypted and signed.

The established queues can also be used to change the encryption keys providing
[forward secrecy][5].

This protocol also can be used for off-the-record messaging, as Alice and Bob
can use multiple queues between them and only information they pass to each
other allows proving their identity, so if they want to share anything
off-the-record they can initiate a new queue without linking it to any other
information they exchanged. As a result, this protocol provides better anonymity
and better protection from [MITM][1] than [OTR][6] protocol.

## SMP qualities and features

The simplex messaging protocol:

- defines only message-passing protocol:
  - transport agnostic - the protocol does not define how clients connect to the
    servers. It can be implemented over any ordered data stream channel: TCP
    connection, HTTP with long polling, websockets, etc..
  - not semantic - the protocol does not assign any meaning to queues and
    messages. While on the application level the queues and messages can have
    different meaning (e.g., for messages: text or image chat message, message
    acknowledgement, participant profile information, status updates, changing
    "public" key to encrypt messages, changing servers, etc.), on the simplex
    messaging protocol level all the messages are binary and their meaning can
    only be interpreted by client applications and not by the servers - this
    interpretation is out of scope of this simplex messaging protocol.
- client-server architecture:
  - multiple servers, that can be deployed by the system users, can be used to
    send and retrieve messages.
  - servers do not communicate with each other and do not "know" about other
    servers.
  - clients only communicate with servers (excluding the initial out-of-band
    message), so the message passing is asynchronous.
  - for each queue, the message recipient defines the server through which the
    sender should send messages.
  - while multiple servers and multiple queues can be used to pass each message,
    it is in scope of application level protocol(s), and out of scope of this
    simplex messaging protocol.
  - servers store messages only until they are retrieved by the recipients, and
    in any case, for a limited time.
  - servers are required to NOT store any message history or delivery log, but
    even if the server is compromised, it does not allow to decrypt the messages
    or to determine the list of queues established by any participant - this
    information is only stored on client devices.
- the only element provided by SMP servers is simplex queues:
  - each queue is created and managed by the queue recipient.
  - assymetric encryption is used to sign and verify the requests to send and
    receive the messages.
  - one unique "public" key is used for the servers to authenticate requests to
    send the messages into the queue, and another unique "public" key - to
    retrieve the messages from the queue. "Unique" here means that each "public"
    key is used only for one queue and is not used for any other context -
    effectively, this key is not public and does not represent any participant
    identity.
  - both "public" keys are provided to the server by the queue recepient when
    the queue is created.
  - the "public" keys known to the server and used to authenticate commands from
    the participants are unrelated to the keys used to encrypt and decrypt the
    messages - the latter keys are also unique per each queue but they are only
    known to participants, not to the servers.
  - messaging graph can be asymmetric: Bob's ability to send messages to Alice
    does not automatically lead to the Alice's ability to send messages to Bob.

## Cryptographic algorithms

Simplex messaging clients need to cryptographically sign commands:

- with the recipient's key `RK` (server to verify):
  - to subscribe to queue.
  - to secure the queue.
  - to acknowledge received messages.
  - to suspend the queue.
  - to delete the queue.
- with the sender's key `SK`:
  - to send messages (server to verify).

To sign and verify commands, clients and servers MUST use RSA-PSS algorythm
defined in [RFC3447][2].

To optinally sign and verify messages, clients SHOULD use RSA-PSS algorythm.

To encrypt and decrypt messages, clients and servers SHOULD use RSA-OAEP
algorythm defined in [RFC3447][2].

The reasons to use these algorithms:

- they are supported by WebCrypto API.
- they are newer versions than RSA-PKCS1-v1_5 encryption and signature schemes.
- they are more widely supported than ECC algorithms

Future versions of the protocol may allow different algorithms.

## Simplex queue IDs

Simplex messaging servers MUST generate 2 different IDs for each new queue - for
recipient (that created the queue) and for sender. It is REQUIRED that:

- these IDs are different and unique within the server.
- based on 64-128-bit integers generated with cryptographically strong
  pseudo-random number generator.

## Server privacy requirements

Simplex messaging server implementations MUST NOT create, store or send to any
other servers:

- logs of the client commands and transport connections in the production
  environment.
- history of deleted queues, retrieved or acknowledged messages.
- snapshots of the database they use to store queues and messages (instead
  simplex messaging clients must manage redundancy by using more than one
  simplex messaging server).
- any other information that may compromise privacy or [forward secrecy][4] of
  communication between clients using simplex messaging servers.

## SMP commands

Commands syntax below is provided using [ABNF][8].

Each transmission between the client and the server must have this format/syntax
(after the decryption):

```abnf
transmission = [signature] CRLF signed CRLF
signed = [corrId] CRLF [queueId] CRLF msg
msg = recipientCmd / send / serverMsg
recipientCmd = create / subscribe / secure / acknowledge / suspend / delete
serverMsg = queueIds / message / unsubscribed / ok / error
corrId = 1*(%x21-7F) ; any characters other than control/whitespace
queueId = encoded ; empty queue ID is used with "create" command
signature = encoded ; empty signature can be used with "create" and "send" commands
encoded = base64
```

`base64` encoding should be used with padding, as defined in section 4 of [RFC
4648][9]

The syntax of specific commands and responses is defined below.

### Correlating responses with commands

The server must send `queueIds`, `error` and `ok` responses in the same order
within each queue ID as the commands received in the transport connection, so
that they can be correlated by the clients.

If the transport connection is closed before some responses are sent, these
responses should be discarded.

### Command authentication

The SMP servers must athenticate all transmissions (excluding `create` and
`send` commands sent with empty signatures) by verifying the provided
signatures. Signature should be the hash of the first part `signed` (including
CRLF characters) of `transmission`, encrypted with the key associated with the
queue ID (sender's or recepient's, depending on which queue ID is used).

### Recipient commands

Sending any of the commands in this section (other than `create`, that is sent
without queue ID) is only allowed with recipient's ID (`RID`). If sender's ID is
used the server must respond with `"ERR AUTH"` response (see
[Error responses](#error-responses)).

#### Create queue command

This command is sent by the recipient to the SMP server to create the new queue.
The syntax is:

```abnf
create = %s"NEW" SP recipientKey
recipientKey = encoded
```

If the queue is created successfully, the server must send `queueIds` response
with the recipient's and sender's queue IDs:

```abnf
queueIds = %s"IDS" SP recipientId SP senderId
recipientId = encoded
senderId = encoded
```

This response should be sent with empty queue ID (the second part of the
transmission).

Once the queue is created, the recipient gets automatically subscribed to
receive the messages from that queue, until the transport connection is closed.
The `subscribe` command is needed only to start receiving the messages from the
existing queue when the new transport queue is opened.

`signature` part of NEW `transmission` should an empty string; SMP servers can
also use it to authenticate users who are allowed to create simplex queues on
the server.

#### Subscribe to queue

When the simplex queue was not created in the current transport connection, the
recipient must use this command to start receiving messages from it:

```abnf
subscribe = %s"SUB"
```

If subscription is successful the server should respond with the first available
message or with `ok` response if no messages are available. The recipient will
continue receiving the messages from this queue until the transport connection
is closed or until another transport connection subscribes to the same simplex
queue - in this case the first subscription should be cancelled and
[subscription END notification](#subscription-end-notification) delivered.

The first message will be delivered either immediately or as soon as it is
available; to receive the following message the recipient must acknoledge the
reception of the message (see
[Acknowledge message delivery](#acknowledge-message-delivery)).

#### Secure queue command

This command is sent by the recipient to the server to add sender's key to the
queue:

```
secure = %s"KEY" SP senderKey
senderKey = encoded
```

`senderKey` is received from the sender as part of the first message - see
[Send Message Command](#send-message-command).

Once the queue is secured only signed messages can be sent to it.

#### Acknowledge message delivery

The recipient should send the acknowledgement of message delivery once the
message was stored in the client, to notify the server that the message should
be deleted:

```abnf
acknowledge = %s"ACK"
```

Even if acknowledgement is not sent by the recipient, the server should limit
the time of message storage, whether it was delivered to the recipient or not.

Having received the acknowledgement, SMP server should immediately delete the
sent message and then send the next available message or respond with `ok` if
there are no more messages stored in this simplex queue.

#### Suspend queue

The recipient can suspend queue prior to deleting it to make sure that no
messages are lost:

```abnf
suspend = %s"OFF"
```

The server must respond with `"ERR AUTH"` to any messages sent after the queue
was suspended (see [Error responses](#error-responses)).

The server must respond `ok` to this command if it was successful.

This command can be sent multiple times (in case transport connection was
interrupted and the response was not delivered), the server should still respond
`ok` even if the queue is already suspended.

There is no command to resume the queue. Servers must delete suspended queues
that were not deleted after some period of time.

#### Delete queue

The recipient can delete the queue, whether it was suspended or not.

All undelivered messages will not be delivered - they should be deleted as soon
as command is received, before the response is sent.

```abnf
delete = %s"DEL"
```

### Sender commands

Currently SMP defines only one command that can be used by senders - `send`
message. This command must be used with sender's ID, if recipient's ID is used
the server must respond with `"ERR AUTH"` response (see
[Error responses](#error-responses)).

#### Send message

This command is sent to the server by the sender both to confirm the queue after
the sender received out-of-band message from the recipient and to send messages
after the queue is secured:

```abnf
send = %s"SEND" SP msgBody
msgBody = stringMsg | binaryMsg
stringMsg = ":" string ; until CRLF in the transmission
string = *(%x01-09 / %x0B-0C / %x0E-FF %) ; any characters other than NUL, CR and LF
binaryMsg = size CRLF msgBody CRLF ; the last CRLF is in addition to CRLF in the transmission
size = 1*DIGIT ; size in bytes
msgBody = *OCTET ; any content of specified size - safe for binary
```

`stringMsg` is allowed primarily to test SMP servers, e.g. via telnet.

The first message is sent to confirm the queue - it should contain sender's
server key (see decrypted message syntax below) - this first message must be
sent without signature.

Once queue is secured (see [Secure queue command](#secure-queue-command)),
messages must be sent with the signature.

The server must respond with `"ERR AUTH"` response in the following cases:

- queue does not exist or suspended,
- queue is secured but the transmission does NOT have a signature,
- queue is NOT secured but the transmission has a signature.

Until the queue is secured, the server should accept any number of unsigned
messages - it both enables the legitimate sender to resend the confirmation in
case of failure and also allows the simplex messaging client to ignore any
confirmation messages that may be sent by the attackers (assuming they could
have intercepted the queue ID in the server response, but do not have a correct
encryption key passed to sender in out-of-band message).

The body should be encrypted with the recipient's "public" key (`EK`); once
decrypted it must have this format:

```abnf
decryptedBody = clientHeader CRLF clientBody CRLF
clientHeader = senderKeyMsg / *VCHAR
senderKeyMsg = %s"KEY" SP senderKey
senderKey = encoded
clientBody = *OCTET
```

`clientHeader` in the initial unsigned message is used to transmit sender's server
key and can be used in the future revisions of SMP protocol for other purposes.

### Server messages

#### Queue IDs response

Server must respond with this message when the new queue is created.

See its syntax in [Create queue command](#create-queue-command)

#### Deliver queue message

The server must deliver messages to all subscribed simplex queues on the
currently open transport connection. The syntax for the message delivery is:

```abnf
message = %s"MSG" SP msgId SP timestamp SP binaryMsg
msgId = encoded
timestamp = date-time; RFC3339
```

`msgId` - unique message ID generated by the server based on 32-64 bits
cryptographically strong random number. It should be used by the clients to
detect messages that were delivered more than once (in case the transport
connection was interrupted and the server did not receive the message delivery
acknowledgement).

`timestamp` - the UTC time when the server received the message from the sender,
must be in date-time format defined by [RFC 3339][10]

`binaryMsg` - see syntax in [Send message](#send-message)

#### Subscription END notification

When another transport connection is subscribed to the same simplex queue, the
server should unsubscribe and to send the notification to the previously
subscribed transport connection:

```abnf
unsubscribed = %s"END"
```

No further messages should be delivered to unsubscribed transport connection.

#### Error responses

The server can respond with an error response in the following cases:

- unknown command name (`"UNKNOWN"`),
- prohibited command (`"PROHIBITED"`) - any server response sent from client or
  `ACK` sent without active subscription or without message delivery,
- incorrect command or transmission syntax (`"SYNTAX"`) - see error codes below
- incorrect message body size (`"SIZE"`)
- authentication error (`"AUTH"`) - incorrect signature, unknown (or suspended)
  queue, sender's ID is used in place of recipient's and vice versa, and some
  other cases (see [Send message command](#send-message-command))
- internal server error (`"INTERNAL"`).

The syntax for error responses:

```abnf
error = %s"ERR " errorType
errorType = %s"UNKNOWN" / %s"PROHIBITED" / %s"SYNTAX " code / %s"SIZE" / %s"AUTH" / %s"INTERNAL"
code = badTransmission / badParameters / noCredentials / hasCredentials / noConnId / msgBody
badTransmission = "1" ; signature or queue ID are not valid base64 encoded string
badParameters = "2" ; incorrect number or format of parameters
noCredentials = "3" ; queue ID and/or signature are required but absent
hasCredentials = "4" ; queue ID and/or signature are not allowed but present
noConnId = "5" ; queue ID is required and absent - only used in SEND command atm
msgBody = "6" ; message body has incorrect format, it is neither a number nor starts from ":"
```

Server implementations must aim to respond within the same time for each command
in all cases when `"ERR AUTH"` response is required to prevent timing attacks
(e.g., the server should execute signature verification even when the queue does
not exist on the server).

### OK response

When the command is successfully executed by the server, it should respond with
OK response:

```abnf
ok = %s"OK"
```

## Appendices

### Appendix A.

Secure encrypted transport connection with the SMP server.

Both the recipient and the sender can use TCP or some other (possibly higher
level) transport protocol to communicate with the server.

Some protocol should be used to ecrypt the connection traffic - one simple
option that does not require any cetralized certificate authority is below.

When the transport connection is established, the server sends the binary
encryption key that the client should match with key or fingerprint available to
them - if they do not match, they should terminate the connection.

The client should respond with the symmetric key that will be used by both the
client and the server to encrypt all traffic in the connection - this key should
be encrypted with the public key initially sent by the server.

After the symmetric key is sent to the server, all communication should happen
in encrypted binary chunks having a fixed size (e.g. 4096 bytes) irrespective of
the size of the command/message that should be sent. Smaller messages should be
padded, multiple commands/messages can be packed into a single chunk. If the
application using SMP needs to transmit a file or a larger message, it should be
broken down into fragments. The format of application level messages within SMP
commands is out of scope of this protocol.

### Appendix B.

Sending out-of-band message.

SMP does not prescribe the channel to pass out-of-band message - it should be
agreed by the client applications.

For practical purposes various solutions can be used, e.g. one of the versions
or the analogues of [QR code][3] (or their sequence) that is read via the
camera, either directly from the participant's device or via the video call.
Although a video call still allows for a highly sophisticated MITM attack, it
would require that in addition to compromising simplex queue to intercept
messages, the attacker also identifies and compromises the video connection in
another channel and substitutes the video in real time.
