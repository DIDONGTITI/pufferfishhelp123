# Making connections

Because you have no user ID on the SimpleX platform, nobody can connect with you unless you share either a one-time invitation or a SimpleX address. Both can be shared as a link or QR code.

## One-time invitations

As the name implies, the invitation expires once the connection is made.  SimpleX Chat allows you to create one-time invitations to send to your contacts. 

#### To create and share a one-time invitation:

1. On Android, tap on the 游둘 (floating pencil) button in the bottom-right corner of the screen. On iOS, tap on the 游둘 (pencil) button in the top-right corner of the screen.
2. Tap **Create one-time invitation link**.
3. (Optional) Toggle **Incognito** on to share a random profile with your contact.
4. (Optional) Go back to your list of chats and then tap and hold (Android) or swipe left (iOS) on your invitation to set a contact name to help remember who you're inviting to connect with you. 
5. Tap **Share 1-time link** to share with your contact from a distance. Or, you can show your QR code in person for your contact to scan. 

## SimpleX address

Want to publish your QR code on your personal website for your visitors to connect with you? SimpleX Chat allows you to create a SimpleX address. Unlike one-time invitations: a SimpleX address can be used multiple times. When people connect with you via your SimpleX address, you will receive a connection request that you can either accept or reject. Optionally, you can configure your SimpleX address to automatically accept future connection requests with a welcome message that will be sent to new contacts when they connect with you and/or to share a random profile with them. If you start receiving too many connection requests via your SimpleX address, you can always delete it. All connections previously made via your SimpleX address will remain active, as it is not used to send messages.

#### To create and share a SimpleX address:

1. [Open app settings](#opening-app-settings).
2. Tap **Your SimpleX address**.
3. Tap **Create SimpleX address**. 
4. (Optional) Tap **Share** to share your SimpleX address with your contacts.

**Please note**: you can only create one SimpleX address per chat profile at this time.

Please read [this blog post](../../blog/20221108-simplex-chat-v4.2-security-audit-new-website.md#auto-accept-contact-requests) for more details. 

#### To enable auto-acceptance of connection requests:

1. [Open app settings](#opening-app-settings).
2. Tap **Your SimpleX address**.
3. Create your SimpleX address, if you haven't already. 
4. Toggle **Auto-accept** on.
5. (Optional) Toggle **Accept Incognito** on and tap **Save**.
6. (Optional) Compose a welcome message and tap **Save**. 

## Connect via link or QR code

Now that you know how to create and share one-time invitations and SimpleX addresses with your contacts. How do you connect with a SimpleX Chat user who's shared their link or QR code with you?

#### To connect via QR code:

1. On Android, tap on the 游둘 (floating pencil) button in the bottom-right corner of the screen. On iOS, tap on the 游둘 (pencil) button in the top-right corner of the screen.
2. Tap **Connect via link / QR code**. 
3. Tap **Scan QR code**, if not selected.
4. (Optional) Toggle **Incognito** on to share a random profile with your contact.
5. Scan your contact's QR code, and they will show up in your list of chats. 

#### To connect via link:

1. On Android, tap on the 游둘 (floating pencil) button in the bottom-right corner of the screen. On iOS, tap on the 游둘 (pencil) button in the top-right corner of the screen.
2. Tap **Connect via link / QR code**. 
3. Tap **Paste received link**, if not selected. 
4. Tap **Paste** to paste the link you received from your contact. 
5. (Optional) Toggle **Incognito** on to share a random profile with your contact.
6. Tap **Connect**.

## Verify connection

You've now connected with your contact, but you want to verify that your connection with them is secure? SimpleX Chat allows you to do this with ease. 

#### To verify security code:

1. Tap on your contact in your list of chats. 
2. Tap on your contact's name at the top of the screen.
3. Tap **Verify security code**.
4. Ask your contact to follow the first three steps and compare your security code with theirs.
5. The connection is secure if both you and your contact have the same security code. This can be validated by one of the following methods:
   - One of you can scan the other's security code in person. If the codes match, the contact will be marked as verified on the device that scanned the code.
   - Simply tap **Mark verified** if you trust the confirmation from your contact that the code is verified.
   - You can also read out your security code over a voice call with your contact.

## Contact preferences

Although SimpleX Chat allows you to configure your default set of chat preferences for your chat profile, you can also adjust them individually for each contact as you see fit. From here you can choose whether you wish to allow disappearing messages, delete for everyone, message reactions, voice messages, and audio/video calls.

#### To set contact preferences:

1. Tap on your contact from your list of chats. 
2. Tap on your contact's name at the top of the screen.
3. Tap **Contact preferences**.
4. Make your changes.
5. Tap **Save and notify contact**.
