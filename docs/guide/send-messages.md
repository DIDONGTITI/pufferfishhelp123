# Sending, editing, quoting, and deleting messages

Sending text messages on SimpleX Chat is pretty straightforward: tap on your contact and then tap on text area, type in your message, and tap ‚¨ÜÔ∏è (send) button.

You need to open a conversation to send messages.

## Sending messages

### Sending text messages

You can send, edit and quote messages in a conversation.

To send, simply type in the message in the text area and tap ‚¨ÜÔ∏è (send) button.

To edit or quote a message, tap and hold the message and choose the action.

### Sending images and files

1. Tap üìé (paperclip) button on the left of the text area.
2. Choose between **Use Camera**, **From Gallery** and **Choose file**.
3. Once you have chosen what you wish to send, tap ‚¨ÜÔ∏è (send) button.

On iOS, you can also paste images from the clipboard.

### Sending voice messages

1. Tap üéôÔ∏è (microphone) button on the right of the text area.
2. Allow SimpleX Chat to record your voice if prompted. You will have to tap on the microphone button once again if this happens.
3. Speak. Once you've finished recording, tap on the square stop icon on the right.
4. (Optional) You may listen to the recording before sending it, and re-record if necessary.
5. Tap ‚¨ÜÔ∏è (send) button to send the recorded voice message.

**Tip:** You can also tap and hold the üéôÔ∏è (microphone) button to record a voice message. In this case the recording will stop once you release the button. You still need to tap ‚¨ÜÔ∏è (send) button to send the message.

**Please note:** If the üéôÔ∏è (microphone) button is grayed out, that means voice messages are disabled in this conversation. Ask your contact or group owner to enable them (they are enabled by default).

### How to use disappearing messages

1. Tap on your contact's name.
2. Toggle **Disappearing messages** on.
3. From the **Delete after** dropdown menu, choose how long until messages are deleted after being sent.
4. Tap **Save and notify contact**. 

**Please note:** An offer will be sent to your contact. They must accept it to enable disappearing messages in your conversation with them. In addition, only a group owner can enable disappearing messages in your group.

### Sending "live" messages

You can use "live" messages for your contacts to see as you type them without having to tap ‚¨ÜÔ∏è (send) button until it's completed. It can be useful in these following scenarios:

1. Real-time conversation, like talking in person or in a discussion club. You can retract what you wrote, but your recipients would see it. Also people don‚Äôt need to guess what you‚Äôre typing. This allows to avoid interrupting the flow of conversation and still send longer messages.
2. An activist doing live reporting when there is a risk of losing the phone or connection at any moment. This feature allows to send as much as possible, up to the last word, without having to send only very short messages.

#### To send a "live" message:

1. Tap ‚ö°Ô∏è (lightning) button on the right of the text area.
2. When you do it first time, you would see and alert explaining the feature. Tap **OK**, and tap it again.

Now you can start typing "live" messages. The app will periodically send updates to your contacts every few seconds as you type only complete words. 

### Sending stickers and animated messages

While there are no stickers and GIFs in the app itself, you can send them using third-party (such as [GIPHY](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/giphy-the-gif-search-engine/id974748812) on iOS) or native (Android 13+) keyboards.

### Message drafts

Messages are kept in the chat until they are sent, even if you leave the chat.

For privacy and simplicity, we decided to allow only one message draft and keep it only until the app is stopped.

## Deleting messages

<img src="../../blog/images/20221206-deleted1.png" width="288"> &nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="../../blog/images/20221206-deleted2.png" width="288">

To delete a message, tap and hold (Android) or swipe (iOS) the message and choose **Delete**.

If you sent this message yourself within the last 24 hours, you will be offered two options:

- `delete for everyone` - this will either mark the message as deleted for you and your recipient(s) (this is the default) or fully delete the message on your and recipients' devices (if you have enabled "Delete for everyone" in the conversation preferences).
- `delete for me` - this will only delete the message on your device.

Please read [this blog post](../../blog/20221206-simplex-chat-v4.3-voice-messages.md#irreversible-message-deletion) for more details on the reasons for not allowing full deletion by default. TL;DR: data sovereignty.

## Moderating messages in groups

Group admins and owners can delete member messages that are inappropriate for groups.

To remove a message of another member, tap and hold (Android) or swipe (iOS) the message and choose **Moderate**.
