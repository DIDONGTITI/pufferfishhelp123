Have something you want to share with your contacts and groups? SimpleX Chat allows you to send images, videos, and files of up to 1GB in size. 

#### To send an image, video, or file:

1. Tap the üìé (attach) button on the left of the text area.
2. Choose either **Camera**, **Image**, **Video**, or **File**.
3. Once you have chosen what you wish to send, tap the ‚¨ÜÔ∏è (send) button.

**Tip:** if you're using iOS, you can also paste images from the clipboard.

### Sending voice messages

Prefer to speak instead of texting? SimpleX Chat allows you to record voice messages of up to 5 minutes. 

#### To send a voice message:

1. Tap the üéôÔ∏è (microphone) button on the right of the text area.
2. Allow SimpleX Chat to record your voice, if prompted. You will have to tap the üéôÔ∏è (microphone) button again if this happens.
3. Speak. 
4. Tap the üü¶ (stop) button on the right-hand side of the text area to stop recording.
5. (Optional) You may listen to the recording before sending it, and re-record if necessary.
6. Tap the ‚¨ÜÔ∏è (send) button to send your recorded voice message.

**Tip:** You can also tap and hold the üéôÔ∏è (microphone) button to record your voice message. In this case, the recording will stop once you release the button. You still need to tap the ‚¨ÜÔ∏è (send) button to send your recorded voice message.

**Please note:** If the üéôÔ∏è (microphone) button is greyed out, that means voice messages are disabled in your conversation. Ask your contact or group owner to enable them. 

### Sending disappearing messages

Worried that your messages will stay in someone else's conversation history? SimpleX Chat allows you to send disappearing messages to your contacts and groups. But before you can send them: you must enable them first, as they are disabled by default. 

#### To enable disappearing messages with your contact:

1. Tap on your contact in your list of chats. 
2. Tap on your contact's name at the top of the screen.
3. Tap **Contact preferences**.
4. Toggle **Disappearing messages** on, if it's toggled off.
5. From the **Delete after** drop-down menu, choose how long until messages are deleted after being sent.
6. Tap **Save and notify contact**. An offer of your chosen timer will then be sent to your contact.

**Please note**: Disappearing messages require mutual consent to be enabled. If your contact doesn't have disappearing messages enabled, they will receive an offer from you to enable disappearing messages with your proposed timer. If they agree to it, then they must tap **Accept** to enable them. If your contact chooses to reject your offer, then disappearing messages will remain disabled until you both agree to a timer that works best for your conversation.

#### To enable disappearing messages in your group:

1. Tap on your group in your list of chats. 
2. Tap on your group's name at the top of the screen.
3. Tap **Group preferences**.
4. Toggle **Disappearing messages** on, if it's toggled off.
5. From the **Delete after** drop-down menu, choose how long until messages are deleted after being sent.
6. Tap **Save and notify group members**.

**Please note**: in a group, only the group owner can enable disappearing messages.

Now that you have disappearing messages enabled, all you have to do is send a message and it will disappear after the timer expires. That's it! But if for some reason you need to set a different timer for an individual message, you do have that option available to you.

#### To set a timer for an individual disappearing message:

1. Compose your message.
2. Tap and hold the ‚¨ÜÔ∏è (send) button.
3. Tap **Disappearing message**.
4. Choose a timer of your choice.

**Please note**: this option is not available if you have disappearing messages disabled in your conversation.

### Sending "live" messages

<img src="../../blog/images/20230103-live.png" width="288">

SimpleX Chat allows you to compose "live" messages for your contacts to see as you type them without having to tap the ‚¨ÜÔ∏è (send) button until it's completed. It can be useful in the following scenarios:

1. Real-time conversation, like talking in person or in a discussion club. You can retract what you wrote, but your recipients would still see it. Also people don‚Äôt need to guess what you‚Äôre typing. This avoids interrupting the flow of conversation and still allow you to send longer messages.
2. An activist doing live reporting when there is a risk of losing their phone or connection at any moment. This feature allows typing as many words as possible until the last word, without having to send only very short messages.

#### To send a "live" message:

1. Tap the ‚ö°Ô∏è (lightning) button on the right of the text area. When you do it the first time, you will see a little popup explaining how the feature works.
2. Tap **OK**.
3. Tap the ‚ö°Ô∏è (lightning) button again.

Done! Now you can start typing "live" messages. The app will periodically send updates to your contacts every few seconds as you type only complete words. 

### Sending stickers and GIFs

While there are no stickers and GIFs available in the app itself, you can still send them using third-party (such as [GIPHY](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/giphy-the-gif-search-engine/id974748812) on iOS) or native (Android 13+) keyboards.

### Message drafts

<img src="../../blog/images/20230204-draft1.png" width="288"> &nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="../../blog/images/20230204-draft2.png" width="288">

Messages are kept in the chat until they are sent, even if you leave the chat.

For privacy and simplicity, we decided to allow only one message draft and keep it only until the app is stopped.

Please read [this blog post](../../blog/20230204-simplex-chat-v4-5-user-chat-profiles.md#message-draft) for more details.

## Editing messages

Made a typo in your message and want to correct it? SimpleX Chat allows you to edit your messages.

#### To edit a message:

1. Tap and hold (Android) or swipe (iOS) your message. 
2. Choose **Edit**.
3. Edit your message. 
4. Tap the ‚¨ÜÔ∏è (send) button.

**Please note:** you only have 24 hours to edit your message after it's sent. 

## Deleting messages

<img src="../../blog/images/20221206-deleted1.png" width="288"> &nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="../../blog/images/20221206-deleted2.png" width="288">

#### To delete a message

1. Tap and hold (Android) or swipe (iOS) the message.
2. Choose **Delete**. 

If you sent a message yourself within the last 24 hours, you will be offered two options when you go to delete it:

- `delete for everyone` - this will either mark the message as deleted for you and your recipient(s) (this is the default setting) or fully delete the message on your and recipients' devices (if you have enabled "Delete for everyone" in the conversation preferences).
- `delete for me` - this will only delete the message from your device.

**Please note**: after 24 hours have passed, the `delete for everyone` option will become unavailable and only the `delete for me` option will remain.

Please read [this blog post](../../blog/20221206-simplex-chat-v4.3-voice-messages.md#irreversible-message-deletion) for more details on the reasons for not allowing full deletion by default. TL;DR: data sovereignty.

### Moderating messages in groups

As a group owner or admin, you can delete inappropriate messages sent in your groups.

#### To moderate a message:

1. Tap and hold (Android) or swipe (iOS) a message.
2. Choose **Moderate**.

Please read [this blog post](../../blog/20230328-simplex-chat-v4-6-hidden-profiles.md#group-community-moderation) for more details on group moderation.

## Quoting messages

Want to reply to a specific message from your contact? SimpleX Chat allows you to quote messages with ease. 

1. Tap and hold (Android) or swipe (iOS) a message. 
2. Choose **Reply**.
3. Type your message.
4. Tap the ‚¨ÜÔ∏è (send) button.

**Tip:** if you're using Android, you can also swipe left on a message to quickly quote it.
