## Quick start

### Install SimpleX Chat

Download SimpleX Chat [here](https://simplex.chat) or follow the installation steps for each platform. 

#### Android

1. Confirm that your phone is running Android 8.0 or later. Note: Android tablets are not supported.
2. Install and open SimpleX Chat from the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=chat.simplex.app), [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/chat.simplex.app/), or as a [standalone apk](https://github.com/simplex-chat/simplex-chat/releases/latest/download/simplex.apk).

#### iOS

1. Confirm that your phone is running iOS 15.0 or later. Note: iPads are not supported.
2. Install and open SimpleX Chat from the [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/simplex-chat/id1605771084). 

### Create your first chat profile

After installing SimpleX Chat:

1. Open the app.
2. Enter your desired display name and full name (optional).
3. Tap **Create**.

**Note**: your chat profile is stored locally on your device; it is not stored anywhere else.

### Choose notifications mode

After creating your first chat profile, the app will then ask you to choose how you want to receive push notifications.

Please read the description for each option. On iOS, it is trade-off between convenience and privacy. On Android, it is a trade-off between notification delays and battery life.

Please read [this blog post](../../blog/20220404-simplex-chat-instant-notifications.md) for more details on the differences between notifications in Android and iOS.

### Connect with the developers

When you start using SimpleX Chat, you can tap on the **chat with the developers** button to ask any questions or just to test the app. Feel free to send any test messages. Please note that this button will disappear once you make the first connection with someone.

#### To connect with the developers at a later time:

1. [Open app settings](./app-settings.md#opening-app-settings).
2. Tap **Send questions and ideas**.

### Join some user groups

There are links to join several [user groups](../../README.md#join-user-groups) available on our GitHub page - join them to ask any questions and discuss ideas. You can also find some other user-managed groups via online search.

#### To join a group via a link:

1. Get a link to a SimpleX user group, which you can get from your existing SimpleX conversations or by finding it online.
2. On Android, tap on the floating pencil button on the bottom-right corner of the screen. On iOS, tap on the pencil button at the top-right corner of the screen.
3. Tap **Connect via link / QR code**.

### Connect with friends

Tell your friends to download SimpleX Chat [here](https://simplex.chat). While they're at it, create a one-time invitation for each one of them and share it either as a QR code in person or as a link from a distance. These will appear as pending connections in your list of chats after they've been created. You can optionally set a contact name for each invitation to help remember who it's for. 

#### Here's how to do it:

1. On Android, tap on the floating pencil button in the bottom-right corner of the screen. On iOS, tap on the pencil button in the top-right corner of the screen.
2. Tap **Create one-time invitation link**. 
3. Tap **Share invitation link** to share it with your friend from a distance. Or, you can show your QR code in person for your friend to scan. 
4. (Optional) Go back to your list of chats and then tap on an invitation to set a contact name.

Now that you've set up your invitations, tell your friends to tap on the new chat button and then tap **Connect via link / QR code**. They can either scan your QR code or paste your link to connect with you. If they opened your link in the browser, they will need to tap on the **Open in mobile app** button on the page to connect with you.

Watch the short video on [the website](https://simplex.chat) to see how it works.

You can also create a [SimpleX contact address](./app-settings.md#your-simplex-contact-address) to manage your connections.

### Explore the app

Most of the app settings are shared between all chat profiles, but some are set to a specific chat profile.
