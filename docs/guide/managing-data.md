# Managing Your Data

## Automatic message deletion

Here you can choose to delete messages from your local chat database after a set period of time.

**Please note**: This option does not delete messages for other users, only for you. It is set independently for each chat profile.

## Chat Database

#### To open your chat database settings:

1. [Open app settings](./app-settings.md#opening-app-settings).
2. Under the **"Settings"** section, tap **Database passphrase & export**.

### Database passphrase

SimpleX Chat's database is initially encrypted with a random passphrase by default, so you have to manually set a new one to export it.

### App data backup

Here you can allow the system to back up app data, wherever it is configured. A new database passphrase must be set to use this.

### Export database

Here you can export the chat database to a file.

### Import database

Here you can import the chat database from a file.

### Delete database

Here you can delete your chat database. WARNING: Unless you have exported it, this results in a loss of all your SimpleX Chat data!

## Delete files and media

You can delete all sent and received files and media stored in the app via this option, without deleting the messages.
