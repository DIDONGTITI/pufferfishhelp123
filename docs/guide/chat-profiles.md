Need to separate your communications with different contacts? SimpleX Chat allows you to create as many chat profiles as you like. You can create one for work, one for family and friends, one for people you don't know or trust online, etc.  As with the first chat profile you've created: they are only stored locally on your device and not anywhere else. 

#### To create an additional chat profile:

1. [Open app settings](./app-settings.md#opening-app-settings).
2. Under the **"You"** section, tap **Your chat profiles**.
3. Confirm with a fingerprint or PIN, in case you have [SimpleX Lock](./app-settings.md#simplex-lock) toggled on.
4. Tap **+ Add profile**.
5. Enter a required display name and an optional full name.
6. Tap **Create**.

## Switching between chat profiles

## Incognito mode

<img src="../../blog/images/20220901-incognito1.png" width="330"> <img src="../../blog/images/20220901-incognito2.png" width="330"> <img src="../../blog/images/20220901-incognito3.png" width="330">

This feature is unique to SimpleX Chat – it is independent from chat profiles. Whether you're creating a one-time invitation link, scanning your contact's QR code, pasting a link received from your contact, joining a group via link, or auto-accepting connection requests via your SimpleX address. The option to toggle incognito mode on or off is readily available at the point of connection. When **Incognito mode** is toggled on, your active chat profile name and picture are NOT shared with your new contacts and groups. Instead a new random profile (without a profile picture and a randomly generated name) will be shared with them, allowing you to have as many anonymous connections with other people without any shared data between them.

## Migrating your chat profiles to another device

SimpleX Chat stores all user data locally on client devices, using a portable encrypted database format that can be exported and migrated to any supported device.

#### To export your SimpleX Chat data:

1. [Open app settings](./app-settings.md#opening-app-settings).
2. Under the **"Settings"** section, tap **Database passphrase & export**.
3. Toggle **Chat is running** off to stop chat. 
4. Tap **Stop** in the confirmation dialog.
5. Confirm it with a fingerprint or PIN, in case you have [SimpleX Lock](./app-settings.md#simplex-lock) toggled on.
6. If you didn't set it before, [set a passphrase](./managing-data.md#database-passphrase) in "Database passphrase". Initially, the database is encrypted with a random passphrase that is stored in KeyChain (iOS) or with KeyStore (Android).
7. Tap **Export database** - it won't allow exporting unless you have set a passphrase.
8. Save the file on your device or share it via any available option.

#### To import your SimpleX Chat data in the app on another device:

1. [Install SimpleX Chat](./README.md#install-simplex-chat) on the new device.
2. Migrate your exported database over to the new device.
3. Create a chat profile with any name by following the steps in [Create your first chat profile](#create-your-first-chat-profile) – you will replace it soon.
4. [Open app settings](./app-settings.md#opening-app-settings).
5. Under the **"Settings"** section, tap **Database passphrase & export**.
6. Toggle **Chat is running** off to stop chat.
7. Tap **Stop** in the confirmation dialog.
8. Tap **Import database**.
9. Select the .zip file containing your exported SimpleX Chat data.
10. Tap **Import** in the confirmation dialog.
11. Toggle **Chat is running** on to start the chat or close and restart the app – you will be prompted to enter the passphrase for your chat database.

**Please note:**

1. Currently you can't migrate your chat profiles individually, only the whole database containing all your chat profiles can be migrated.

2. You must NOT use your exported database on more than one device at a time, and you also must always use the latest version of your chat database. Otherwise, your connections might get disrupted.

3. There is no way to recover a lost database passphrase. Please make sure to store it securely.
