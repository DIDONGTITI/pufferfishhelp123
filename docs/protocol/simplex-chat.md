# SimpleX Chat Protocol

## Abstract

SimpleX Chat Protocol is a protocol used to by SimpleX Chat clients to exchange messages. This protocol relies on a lower level SimpleX protocol - SimpleX Messaging Agent protocol. SimpleX Chat Protocol describes the format of messages and the client operations that should be performed when receiving such messages.

## Scope

The scope of SimpleX Chat Protocol is application level messages, both for chat functionality, related to the conversations between the clients, and extensible for any other application functions. Supported chat functions:

- direct and group messages
- message replies (quoting), forwarded messages and message deletions
- message attachments: images and files
- creating and managing chat groups
- invitation and signalling for audio/video WebRTC calls

## General message format

SimpleX Chat protocol supports two message formats:

- JSON-based format for chat and application messages.
- binary format for sending files or any other binary data.

### JSON format for chat and application messages

This document uses JTD schemas (RFC 8927) to define the properties of chat messages, with additional restrictions on message properties included in metadata member of JTD schemas. Message examples are also provided for simplicity, in case of any contradiction between examples and JTD schema the latter should be considered correct.

While JSON examples include whitespace, the SimpleX Chat Protocol clients should avoid using whitespace when encoding messages.

General message format is defined by this JTD schema:

```JSON
{
  "properties": {
    "event": {
      "type": "string"
    },
    "msgId": {
      "type": "string",
      "metadata": {
        "format": "base64url-encoded 12 bytes random message ID"
      }
    },
    "params": {
      "optionalProperties": {}
    }
  }
}
```

For example, this message defines a simple text message `"hello!"`:

```JSON
{
  "event": "x.msg.new",
  "msgId": "abcd",
  "params": {
    "content": {
      "type": "text",
      "text": "hello!"
    }
  }
}
```

`msgId` property is a 12 bytes base64url-encoded random message ID that the clients can use to reference the message in the future, e.g. when editing, quoting or deleting it.

`event` property is the type of the message that defines the semantics of the message and the allowed format of `params` property.

`params` property includes message data, as defined by `event`.

### Binary format for sending files

SimpleX Chat clients use separate connections to send files using a binary format. File chunk size should not be bigger than 15780 bytes to fit into 16kb (16384 bytes) transport block.

The syntax of each message used to send files is defined by the following ABNF notation:

```abnf
fileMessage = fileChunk / cancelFile
fileChunk = %s"F" chunkNo chunk
cancelFile = %s"C"
chunkNo = 4*4 OCTET ; 32bit-word sequential chunk number, starting from 1, in network encoding
chunk = 1*15780 OCTET ; file data, up to 15780 bytes
```

The first chunk number MUST be 1.

## Supported JSON message types and SimpleX Chat sub-protocols

Message type is sent as a string in `"event"` property of the JSON message. General syntaxt of events is dot-separated words in Latin letters, with the first word (usually, a single letter) defining a protocol namespace, the second word defining sub-protocol, and other optional words defining a specific message. All SimpleX Chat Protocol messages related to chat functions are defined in `"x"` namespace.

Sub-protocol is a group of messages for related message functions - e.g. sending files, managing groups or negotiating WebRTC calls.

SimpleX Chat Protocol supports the following message types passed in `"event"` property of each message:

- `x.contact` - contact profile and additional data sent as part of contact request to a long-term contact address.
- `x.info*` - messages to send, update and de-duplicate contact profiles.
- `x.msg.*` - messages to send, update and delete content messages.
- `x.file.*` - messages to offer and accept files (see files sub-protocol)
- `x.grp.*` - messages used to manage groups (see group sub-protocol):
- `x.call.*` - messages to invite to WebRTC calls and send signalling messages
- `x.ok` - message sent during connection handshake

JTD schema defining messages for all chat functions is available in [this file](./simplex-chat.schema.json) â€“ please refer to this document for all properties of the message `params`.

## x.contact - sending connection request

The message is sent as part of the connection request to the long-term user address.

## Sub-protocol for contact profile

### x.info - contact profile

This message is sent by both sides of the connection during the connection handshake, and can be sent later as well when contact profile is updated.

### x.info.probe - the probe to deduplicate contacts

This message is sent to all new group members introduced to you, to allow deduplicating contacts in case you already connected to a user with this profile. The reason it is sent to all newly introduced members, unconditionally, is to avoid leaking information whether you are already connected to the user with the same profile.

### x.info.probe.check - the hash of the probe used to deduplicate contacts

This message is sent to your existing contact when its profile matches the profile of new member. In case this user received probe of which this message contains hash, the contact will reply with `x.info.probe` containing the original probe.

## Sub-protocol for content messages

### x.msg.new - a new content message

### x.msg.update - update of the previously sent message

### x.msg.del - request to delete previously sent message

## Sub-protocol for sending and receiving files

### x.file.acpt - accept file offered as message attachment

This message is used in case when file connection address was included in the message (that is the case when file was sent in direct message). It is sent as part of file connection handshake.

### x.file.acpt.inv - accept file and send connecting address

This message is used in group conversations, it includes the connection address. It is sent in the same connection where the file was offered and must reference the original message.

### x.file.cancel - notify recipient that sending of the file was cancelled

This message is sent in response to accepting the file with `x.file.acpt.inv` message. It is sent in the same connection where the file was offered.

## Sub-protocol for chat groups

### x.grp.inv - send invitation to join the group

This message is sent in direct connection

### x.grp.acpt - accept invitation to join the group

This message is sent as part of group member connection handshake, only to the inviting user.

### x.grp.mem.new - announcing new group member to all other members

This message is sent by the inviting user to all connected members (and scheduled as pending to all announced but not yet connected members).

### x.grp.mem.intro - introduction of existing member to invited member

The inviting user sends one message of this type for each current member to the invited member

### x.grp.mem.inv - invitation to connect from the invited member

The invited user sends one message of this type for each member introduced with `x.grp.mem.intro` message to the inviting user.

### x.grp.mem.fwd - forwarded invitation to connect from the new member

The inviting user forwards the invitations received from invited member in `x.grp.mem.inv` messages to all other members.

### x.grp.mem.info - member profile

This message is sent as part of connection handshake between members.

### x.grp.mem.del - delete member from the group

This message is sent to all members by the member who deletes the member referenced in this message.

### x.grp.leave - leave group

This message is sent to all members by the member leaving the group.

### x.grp.del - delete the group

This message is sent to all members by the member who deletes the group.

### x.grp.info - update group profile

This message is sent to all members by the member who updated group profile.

## Sub-protocol for WebRTC calls

### x.call.inv - send invitation to WebRTC call

### x.call.offer - send WebRTC offer and ICE candidates

### x.call.answer - send WebRTC answer and ICE candidates

### x.call.extra - send additional ICE candidates

### x.call.end - send call termination
