# SimpleX Directory Service

You can use an experimental directory service to discover the groups created and registered by other users.

## Searching for groups

Connect to the directory service via this address and send the message containing the words you want found in the group name or welcome message. You will receive up to 10 groups with the largest number of members in the response, together with the links to join these groups.

## Registering the group

###Â How to register the group

To register the group you must be the owner of the group. Once you connect to the directory service and send `/help`, the service will guide you through the process.

1. Invite SimpleX Service Directory to the group as `admin` member.

The directory service needs to be admin to provide a good user experience of joining the group, as it will create a new link to join the group and it is expected to be online 99% of the time.

2. Add the link sent to you by the directory service to the group welcome message. This has to be done by the same group member who invited the directory service to the group. This member will be the owner of the group registration record in the directory service.

3. Once the link is added, the group will need to be approved by the directory service admins. This link is functional even before the group is approved, and you can continue using this link even if the group is not approved.

The group is usually approved within 24 hours. Please see below which groups can be registered.

Once the group is approved, it will appear in search results.

You can list all the groups you submitted for the registration by sending `/list` to the directory service.

## How to remove the group from the directory

Changing the group profile in any way (e.g., changing the group name, welcome message, or removing the link to join the group from the welcome message) will remove the group from the search results until the group is approved again by the directory service admins.

If it is undesirable that the service cannot be found in search during this time, please coordinate the time of this change with the directory service admins for quick approval.

Changing the role of the directory service will temporarily remove the group from the search results, and unless you changed the role to the `owner`, it will also permanently disrupt the members that were in the process of connecting to other members via the directory service.

To remove the group from the directory:

1. Remove the group link created by the directory service from the welcome message. This will not disrupt the members from joining the group, even via this link, but will remove the group from the search results.
2. After some time (we recommend 3-4 days) remove the directory service from the group - it will stop receiving the messages and the group will be permanently removed from the search results.

Removing the group does not prevent you from registering the group again in the future.

### Why limit which groups can be listed

We are partially responsible for the content that the users can discover via the app. While currently the discovery service is not preset in the app, we eventually want to have it present in the app, potentially with some alternative discovery services, and the content in them should be restricted to generally appropriate to avoid violating the policies of the application distribution channels (App Store, Play Store, etc.).

Doesn't it go against the idea of decentralization and freedom of speech?

No, it does not, as:
1. The service can only restrict the groups that you choose to register.
2. The service itself is open-source and you can self-host it, applying different content policies there.

### Which groups can be registered

Currently, the group registration is limited and manual, as we have limited resources to evaluate the content of the groups, so the initial content policy is quite restrictive - we believe it is better to be able to extend what is allowed, than to have to reduce it.

To be "listed in the directory" <sup>\*</sup>, the group must have at least 10 members. The group profiles and group owner profiles must include appropriate, non-offensive avatar images.

Please ONLY submit the groups on the following subjects:
- communications solutions and providers (messengers, social networks, Internet, etc.)
- privacy and security
- cryptocurrencies
- product and software development
- science and technology
- media and entertainment: books, music, movies and games
- politics, society, culture and education

The content in the group must be "appropriate" for the general audience, starting from 12 years old.

The content in the listed groups must:
- be legal for the jurisdiction you are in.
- NOT contain spam and advertising.
- NOT contain violence, calls for violence, calls for public demonstrations, or any other disturbing content.
- NOT contain pornography, nudity, erotic or any sex-related content.
- NOT contain racism, hate speech, or any other content that promotes discrimination.
- NOT contain information about drugs, alcohol, or any other substances.
- NOT contain [NSFW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_safe_for_work) content.
- be offensive. We cannot say in advance what "offensive" means, but we will know it when we see it.

Group owners are responsible for moderating the content in the group, if members post inappropriate or excessive amount of content and group owners do not moderate it, the group is likely to be removed from the directory.

We reserve the right refuse to approve the group listing in the directory or cancel its listing without providing any explanations.

The combination of display name and full name has to be unique for the listed groups.

Once the group is listed in the directory, the bot will invite you to join the group of the group owners, where you can send any ideas or suggestions for how the groups functionality should evolve, and help steer both the product and the policies.
