## Link mobile and desktop apps via secure quantum-resistant protocol

This release allows to use chat profiles you have in mobile app from desktop app.

This is only possible when both devices are connected to the same local network. To send and receive messages mobile app has to be connected to the Internet.

### Quick start - how to use it

TODO screenshots

If you don't have desktop app installed yet, download it and create any chat profile - you don't need to use it, and when you create it there are no server requests and no accounts are created. Think about it as about user profile in your computer.

Then in desktop app settings choose *Link a mobile* - it will show a QR code.

In mobile app settings choose *Use from desktop*, scan the QR code and verify session code when it appears on both devices - it should be the same.

The devices are now paired, and you can continue using all mobile profiles from desktop.

If it is an Android app, you can put it in background, but on iOS the app has to remain open. In any case, while you are using mobile profiles from desktop, you won't be able to use mobile app.

The subsequent connections happen much faster - by default, the desktop app broadcasts its session address to the network, in encrypted form, and mobile app can connec to it once you choose *Use from desktop* in mobile app settings.

### How does it work?

The way we designed this solution avoided any security compromises, and the end-to-end encryption remained as secure as it was - it uses [double-ratchet algorithm](../docs/GLOSSARY.md#double-ratchet-algorithm), with [perfect forward secrecy](../docs/GLOSSARY.md#forward-secrecy), [post-compromise security](../docs/GLOSSARY.md#post-compromise-security) and deniability.

This solution is similar to WhatsApp and WeChat. But unlike these apps, no server is involved in the connection between mobile and desktop. The connection itself uses a new SimpleX Remote Control Protocol (XRCP) based on secure TLS 1.3 and additional quantum-resistant encryption inside TLS. You can read XRCP protocol specification and threat model in [this document](https://github.com/simplex-chat/simplexmq/blob/master/rfcs/2023-10-25-remote-control.md).

The downside of this approach is that mobile device has to be connected to the same local network (and in case of iOS, the app has to be in the foreground as well). But the upside is that the connection is secure, and you do not need to have a copy of all your data on desktop, which usually has lower security than mobile.

## Better groups

### Faster to join, with more reliable message delivery

We improved the protocols for groups, by making joining groups much faster, and also by adding message forwarding. Previously, the problem was that until a new member establishes a direct connection with each group member, they did not see messages from all members, and the other members did not see messages from the new group members. This problem is explained in the video starting from ... TODO.

With v5.4, the admin who added members to the group forwards messages to and from the new members from all other members until they connect directly. So you should no longer miss any messages and replies to messages you have never seen - once all group members upgrade, you will start receiving all messages.

### Create groups with incognito profile

Previously, you could only create groups with your main profile. You could, as a workaround, add yourself to this group with an incognito profile, make this new member an owner, and then make group creator leave the group. This version allows creating groups with incognito profile directly. You will not be able to add your contacts directly, they can only join via group link.

### Block group members to reduce spam.

You now can block messages from group members that send too many messages, or the messages you don't won't to see. It won't affect other group members, and blocked members won't know that you blocked their messages. When they send messages they will appear in the conversation as one line, showing how many of their messages were blocked. You can reveal them, or delete all sequential blocked messages at once.

### Prohibit files and media in a group

Group owners now have an option of prohibiting sending files and media in a group. This can be useful if you don't won't any images shared, and only want to allow text messages.

## Better calls

Calls in SimpleX Chat still require a lot of work to become stable, but this version imroved the speed of connection, and calls now should work for more users.

We also added screen sharing in video calls in desktop app.
