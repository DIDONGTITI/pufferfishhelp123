## Help us with donations

Huge thank you to everybody who donated to SimpleX Chat!

We are prioritizing users privacy and security - it would be impossible without your support.

Our pledge to our users is that SimpleX protocols are and will remain open, and in public domain, - so anybody can build the future implementations of the clients and the servers. We are building SimpleX platform based on the same principles as email and web, but much more private and secure.

Your donations help us raise more funds â€“ any amount, even the price of the cup of coffee, makes a big difference for us.

See [this section](https://github.com/simplex-chat/simplex-chat/tree/master#help-us-with-donations) for the ways to donate.

Thank you,

Evgeny
