# Federated chat system with [E2EE][1] and low risk of [MITM][2] attack

## Problems

Existing chat platforms and protocols have some or all of the following problems:
- privacy of the conversation, partially caused by [E2EE][1] implementations.
- privacy of the user profile and connections.
- unsolicited messages (spam and abuse).
- lack of data ownership and protection.
- complexity of usage for all non-centralised protocols to all non-technical users

Some of these problems are covered in more details in the proposed protocols on which this chat system will be based on:
- [edge-messaging][6] - low level client-server protocol for asynchronous distributed unidirectional messaging
- [graph-chat][8] - high level chat protocol for client applications that communicate via edge-messaging protocol

Even though EU-wide GDPR legislation to ensure users' privacy and data protection was adopted, the centralisation of the communication in a small number of platforms makes resolving these problems quite difficult.


## Privacy requirements

- User profile is only visible to the proifle connections, but not to the chat network
- User profile is not stored on the servers.
- Profile connections are not stored on the server.
- It should not be possible to construct the list of user connections by analysing server database or any logs.
- It should not be possible, other than by compromising the client, to send messages from another user profile.
- It should not be possible, other than by compromising all servers the user is connected to, to prevent message delivery to a user.
- All participants of the conversation should be able to:
  - prove that the received messages were actually sent by another party.
  - prove that the sent messages were received by another party.


## Chat scenarios

Any advanced chat system needs to support several main chat scenarios:
- direct messaging.
- group chat.
- broadcasts.

In addition to that, there are other important chat scenarios:
- [OTR messaging][3]
- multiple user devices sharing contacts and conversation histories.
- introductions

While it is not required to be supported in the v1 of the protocol, it is important to have clarity on how all these scenarios can be supported in the future.


## Chat system features

- No user identity known to system servers - no phone numbers, user names and no DNS are used to identify the users to the system.
- Each user can be connected to multiple servers to ensure message delivery even if some of the servers are compromised.
- Uses standard assymetric cryptographic protocols, so system users can create independent server and client implementations complying with the protocols.
- Open-source server implementations that can be easily deployed by any user with minimal technical expertise (e.g. on Heroku via web UI).
- Open-source mobile client implementations (including web client) so that system users can independently assess system security model.
- Only client applications store user profiles, contacts of other user profiles, messages; servers do NOT have access to any of this information (and unless compromised, do NOT store encrypted messages or any logs).
- Multiple client applications and devices can be used by each user profile to communicate and to share connections and message history - the devices are not known to the servers.
- Initial key exchange and establishing connections between user profiles is done by sharing QR code via any independent communication channel (or directly via screen and camera), system servers are NOT used for key exchange - to reduce risk of key substitution in [MITM][2] attack. QR code contains the connection-specific public key and other information needed to establish connection.
- Connections between users can be established via shared trusted connections to simplify key exchange.
- Servers do NOT communicate with each other, they only communicate with client applications.
- Unique public key is used for each user profile connection in order to:
  - reduce the risk of attacker posing as user's connection
  - avoid exposing all user connections to the servers
- Unique public key is used to identify each connection participant to each server.
- Public keys used between connections are regularly rotated to prevent decryption of the full message history ([forward secrecy][4]) in case when some servers or middle-men preserve message history and the current key is compromised.
- Users can repeat key exchange using QR code and alternative channel at any point to increase communication security and trust.
- No single server in the system has visibility of all connections or messages of any user, as user profiles are identified by multiple rotating public keys, using separate key for each profile connection.
- User profile (meta-data of the user including non-unique name / handle and optional additional data, e.g. avatar and status) is stored in the client apps and is shared only with accepted user profile connections.


## System components

- edge-messaging servers
- graph-chat client applications (using edge-messaging protocol to communicate with the servers)


### Chat servers

Edge-messaging servers can be either available to all users or only to users who have a valid URI to create connections (see [edge-messaging protocol][6]).


### Chat client application

Graph-chat applications are installed by users on their devices.

Client apps should provide the following features:

- create and manage user profiles
- support multiple user profiles.
- share access to all or selected user profiles with other devices (optionally including existing connections and message histories).
- for each user profile:
  - generate and show QR code with connection-specific public key and other information that can be shown on the screen and/or sent via alternative channel.
  - read QR code (via the camera) to establish connection with another user.
  - receive and accept connection requests.
  - exchange user profiles once connection is accepted.
  - send messages to connected user profiles.
  - receive messages from connected user profile.
  - define the servers to use.
  - store history of all conversations encrypted using user client app key with passphrase (or some other device specific encryption method).


## System design

The chat system design is based on 2 protocols, each with the generic part, describing protocol flow and logic, and implementation part, describing protocol transports, data structures and algorithms.

1. [edge-messaging protocol][6] - a low level generic messaging protocol that defines establishing and using a unidirectional connection ("graph edge") between chat participants on a single server. While this protocol is designed to support graph-chat client protocol (below), it can be used for other messaging scenarios, not limited to chats.
2. [edge-messaging protocol implementation][7] - requirements to clients and servers implementing edge-messaging protocol, including:
   - cryptographic algorithms to sign/verify requests and to encrypt/decrypt messages.
   - privacy requirements to the servers.
   - REST API for connections and messages.
   - WebSocket API to subscribe to connections and receive new messages.
   - other requirements for edge-messaging servers.
3. [graph-chat protocol][8] - a high level generic chat protocol for client applications (graph vertices) that communicate via connections (graph edges) created using edge-messaging protocol. This protocol defines connection and message types and semantics for:
   - various chat elements (user profiles, direct chats, chat groups, broadcasts, etc.).
   - other communication scenarios - e.g. introduction, off-the-record chat, etc.
   - using multiple servers to ensure message delivery.
   - sharing user profiles, contacts and chats across multiple client devices.
   - changing cryptographic keys and servers used to send and receive messages using edge-messaging server protocol.
   - sending and receiving out-of-band messages between client applications using "visual code".
4. graph-chat client application protocol (TODO) - a high level specific chat protocol for client applications. This protocol specifies:
   - data structures for sending and receiving messages of all types.
   - process to send and receive out-of-band messages between client applications.
   - other requirements for graph-chat client applications.
   - defines a specific "visual code" format to send an out-of-band message.
