    Unlike other messaging platforms, SimpleX has <strong>no identifiers assigned to the users</strong>.
    It does not rely on phone numbers, domain-based addresses (like email or XMPP),
    usernames, public keys or even random numbers to identify its users &mdash;
    we don&apos;t know how many people use our SimpleX servers.

    To deliver messages SimpleX uses
    <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/Pairwise_Pseudonymous_Identifier">pair-wise anonymous addresses</a>
    of unidirectional message queues, separate to receive and send messages,
    usually via different servers.
    Using SimpleX is like having <strong>a different &ldquo;burner&rdquo; emails or phones
    for each contact</strong>, and no hassle to manage them.
</p>
<p>
    This design protects the privacy of who are you communicating with,
    hiding it from SimpleX platform servers and from any observers.
    To hide your IP address from the servers, you can <strong>connect to SimpleX servers via Tor</strong>.
