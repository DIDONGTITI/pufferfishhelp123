<p>
    As you have no identifier or fixed address on the SimpleX platform,
    nobody can contact you unless you share a one-time
    or temporary user address, as a QR code or a link.
</p>
<p>
    Even with the optional user address, while it can be used to send spam contact requests,
    you can change or completely delete it without losing any of your connections.
