## Abstract

The purpose of SMP agent protocol is to define the syntax and the semantics of communications between the client and the agent that connects to [SMP](./simplex-messaging.md) servers.

It provides:
- convenient protocol to create and manage a bi-directional (duplex) connection to the users of SMP agents consisting of two separate unidirectional (simplex) SMP queues, abstracting away multiple steps required to establish bi-directional connections.
- management of E2E encryption between SMP agents, generating ephemeral RSA keys for each connection.
- SMP command authentication on SMP servers, generating ephemeral RSA keys for each SMP queue.
- TCP transport handshake and encryption with SMP servers.
- validation of message integrity.

SMP agent protocols provides no encryption or any security on the client side - it is assumed that the agent is executed in the trusted and secure environment.

The future versions of this protocol could provide:
- managing redundant SMP queues with more than 1 queue in each direction.
- managing simple symmetric groups as a foundation for chat groups and device synchronization.
- agent cluster - synchronizing states of multiple agents.
- secure "synchronous" streams with symmetric message encryption and connection-level authentication (requires extending SMP protocol) - it can be used, e.g., for file transfers.

## SMP agent

SMP agent is a client-side process or library that communicates via SMP servers using [simplex messaging protocol (SMP)](./simplex-messaging.md) with other SMP agents according to the commands received from its users. This protocol is a middle layer in SMP protocols stack (above SMP protocol but below any application level protocol) - it is intended to be used by client-side applications that need secure asynchronous bi-directional communication channels ("connections").

The agent must have a persistent storage to manage the states of known connections and of the client-side information of two SMP queues that each connection consists of, and also the buffer of the most recent messages. The number of the messages that should be stored is implementation specific, depending on the error management approach that the agent implements; at the very least the agent must store the hash and id of the last received message.

## SMP agent protocol components

SMP agent protocol has 3 main parts:

- the syntax and semantics of messages that SMP agents exchange between each other in order to:
  - negotiate establishing unidirectional (simplex) encrypted queues on SMP server(s)
  - exchange client messages and delivery notifications, providing sequential message IDs and message integrity (by including the hash of the previous message).
- the syntax and semantics of the commands (a higher level interface than SMP protocol) that are sent over TCP or other sequential protocol by agent clients to the agents. This protocol allows to create and manage multiple connections, each consisting of two simplex SMP queues.
- the syntax and semantics of the message that the clients of SMP agents should send out-of-band (as pre-shared "invitation" including SMP server, queue ID and encryption key) to ensure [E2E encryption][1] the integrity of SMP queues and protection against active attacks ([MITM attacks][2]).

## Communication between SMP agents

SMP agents communicate via SMP servers managing creation, deletion and operations of SMP queues.

Agents can use SMP message client body (the part of the SMP message after header - see SMP protocol) to transmit agent client messages and exchange messages between each other.

Each SMP message client body, once decrypted, contains 3 parts (one of them may include binary message body), as defined by `decryptedSmpMessageBody` syntax:

- `agentMsgHeader` - agent message header that contains sequential agent message ID for a particular SMP queue, agent timestamp (ISO8601) and the hash of the previous message.
- `agentMessage` - a command/message to the other SMP agent:
  - to establish the connection with two SMP queues (`helloMsg`, `replyQueueMsg`)
  - to send and to acknowledge user messages (`clientMsg`, `acknowledgeMsg`)
  - to notify another agent about queue deletion (`deleteQueueMsg`)
- `msgPadding` - an optional message padding to make all SMP messages have consistent size as an additional privacy protection measure.

### Messages between SMP agents

Message syntax below uses [ABNF][1].

```abnf
decryptedSmpMessageBody = agentMsgHeader CRLF agentMessage CRLF msgPadding
agentMsgHeader = agentMsgId SP agentTimestamp SP previousMsgHash
agentMsgId = 1*DIGIT ; sequential agent message ID set by the sending agent

agentMessage = helloMsg / replyQueueMsg / deleteQueueMsg
               / clientMsg / acknowledgeMsg

msgPadding = *OCTET ; optional random bytes to get messages to the same size (as defined in SMP message size)

helloMsg = %s"HELLO" SP signatureVerificationKey [SP %s"NO_ACK"]
; NO_ACK means that acknowledgements to client messages will NOT be sent in this connection by the agent that sent `HELLO` message.
signatureVerificationKey = encoded ; base64 encoded

replyQueueMsg = %s"REPLY" SP qInfo ; `qInfo` is the same as in out-of-band message
; this message can only be sent by the second connection party

deleteQueueMsg = %s"DEL" ; notification that recipient queue will be deleted
; no need to notify the other party about suspending queue separately, as suspended and deleted queues are the same to the sender 

clientMsg = %s"MSG" SP size CRLF clientMsgBody CRLF ; CRLF is in addition to CRLF in decryptedSmpMessageBody
size = 1*DIGIT
clientMsgBody = *OCTET

acknowledgeMsg = %s"ACK" SP agentMsgId SP ackStatus

ackStatus = %s"OK" / ackError

ackError = %s"ERR" SP ackErrorType

ackErrorType = ackUnknownMsg / ackProhibitedMsg / ackSyntaxErr

ackUnknownMsg = %s"UNKNOWN"

ackProhibitedMsg = %"PROHIBITED" ; e.g. "HELLO" or "REPLY"

ackSyntaxErr = %"SYNTAX" SP syntaxErrCode
syntaxErrCode = 1*DIGIT ; TODO
```

## SMP agent commands

This part describes the transmissions between users and client-side SMP agents: commands that the users send to create and operate duplex connections and SMP agent responses and messages they deliver.

Commands syntax below is provided using [ABNF][1].

Each transmission between the user and SMP agent must have this format/syntax:

```abnf
agentTransmission = [corrId] CRLF [cAlias] CRLF agentCommand

corrId = 1*(%x21-7F) ; any characters other than control/whitespace

cAlias = cId / cName
cId = encoded
cName = 1*(ALPHA / DIGIT / "_" / "-")

agentCommand = (userCmd / agentMsg) CRLF
userCmd = newCmd / joinCmd
          / acceptCmd / subscribeCmd
          / sendCmd / acknowledgeCmd
          / suspendCmd / deleteCmd

agentMsg = invitation / confirmation
          / connected / unsubscribed
          / message / sent / received
          / ok / error

newCmd = %s"NEW" SP smpServer [SP %s"NO_ACK"]
; response is `invitation` or `error`
smpServer = srvHost [":" port] ["#" keyFingerprint]
srvHost = hostname ; RFC1123, RFC5891
port = 1*DIGIT
keyFingerprint = encoded

invitation = %s"INV" SP qInfo

connected = %s"CON"

subscribeCmd = %s"SUB"

unsubscribed = %s"END"
; when another agent (or another client of the same agent)
; subscribes to the same SMP queue on the server

joinCmd = %s"JOIN" SP qInfo
                [SP (smpServer / %s"NO_REPLY")] ; reply queue SMP server
                ; server from qInfo is used by default
                [SP %s"NO_ACK"]         
; response is `connection` or `error`

confirmation = %s"CONF" SP partyId SP partyInfo
; currently not implemented

acceptCmd = %s"LET" SP partyId ; response is `ok` or `error`
; currently not implemented

suspendCmd = %s"OFF" ; can be sent by either party, response `ok` or `error`

deleteCmd = %s"DEL" ; can be sent by either party, response `ok` or `error`

sendCmd = %s"SEND" SP msgBody
; send syntax is similar to that of SMP protocol, but it is wrapped in SMP message
msgBody = stringMsg | binaryMsg
stringMsg = ":" string ; until CRLF in the transmission
string = *(%x01-09 / %x0B-0C / %x0E-FF %) ; any characters other than NUL, CR and LF
binaryMsg = size CRLF msgBody CRLF ; the last CRLF is in addition to CRLF in the transmission
size = 1*DIGIT ; size in bytes
msgBody = *OCTET ; any content of specified size - safe for binary

sent = %s"SENT" SP agentMsgId

message = %s"MSG" SP msgStatus
          SP %s"R=" agentMsgId "," agentTimestamp ; receiving agent
          SP %s"B=" brokerMsgId "," srvTimestamp ; broker (server)
          SP %s"S=" agentMsgId "," agentTimestamp ; sending agent
          SP binaryMsg
agentMsgId = 1*DIGIT
srvTimestamp = date-time ; RFC3339
agentTimestamp = date-time
msgStatus = ok / messageError

messageError = %s"ERR" SP messageErrorType
messageErrorType = skippedMsgErr / badMsgIdErr / badHashErr

skippedMsgErr = %"IDS" SP missingFromMsgId SP missingToMsgId
badMsgIdErr = %"ID" SP previousMsgId ; ID is lower than the previous
badHashErr = %"HASH"

acknowledge = %s"ACK" SP agentMsgId ; ID assigned by receiving agent (in MSG "R")

received = %s"RCVD" SP agentMsgId ; ID assigned by sending agent (in SENT response)

ok = %s"OK"

error = %s"ERR" SP errorType

encoded = base64
```

## Connection invitation

Connection invitation `qInfo` is generated by SMP agent in response to `newCmd` command (`"NEW"`), used by another party user with `joinCmd` command (`"JOIN"`), and then another invitation is sent by the agent in `replyQueueMsg` and used by the first party agent to connect to the reply queue (the second part of the process is invisible to the users).

Connection invitation is a text with the following syntax:

```
qInfo = %s"smp::" smpServer "::" queueId "::" ephemeralPublicKey
queueId = encoded
ephemeralPublicKey = encoded ; RSA key for sender to encrypt messages X509 base64 encoded
